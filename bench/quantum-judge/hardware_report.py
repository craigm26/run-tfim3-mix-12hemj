hardware_report.py — verify a REAL-HARDWARE run report against a sim-verified design.

The hermetic simulator judge stays the canonical, reproducible score. A run on an
actual QPU is NOT re-executable by a third party (noise, nondeterminism, queue), so a
hardware report is treated as a labeled OVERLAY with two layers:

  • RE-VERIFIABLE layer — the *metric recomputed from the reported raw counts*. Given
    the counts, anyone recomputes the same expectation value deterministically. This
    catches a report whose headline number doesn't match its own data.
  • ATTESTED layer — that those counts actually came from backend X at time T. We do
    NOT (cannot) re-run the device; provenance is recorded (backend, job_id,
    calibration) and trusted-but-labeled. A hardware report never outranks the sim
    score; it validates the design on real silicon.

This verifier checks: (1) the attested design is itself sim-ACCEPTed by judge_verify;
(2) the report's measured metric is reproduced by recomputing it from the raw counts;
(3) schema sanity. Exit 0 = consistent + attested; non-zero = the report contradicts
its own data or attests an un-accepted design.
