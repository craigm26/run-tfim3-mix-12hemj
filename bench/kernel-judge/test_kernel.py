"""
test_kernel.py — regression suite for the Oracle-Diff Gate hermetic judge.

Same expect-pass / expect-fail discipline as bench/quantum-judge/test_judge.py:
the genuine kernel bundles must ACCEPT, and every class of forgery must be
REJECTED with the right exit code. If this suite is green, the correctness notary
is sound — no swapped array, claimant-chosen tolerance, degraded fast path, or
overfit kernel can clear the gate, and every check runs offline with numpy alone.

Checks are labelled K1–K12 to match the VERIFIER-MAP in ../../TPU-ORACLE-DIFF-GATE.md.

Run:  python3 test_kernel.py   (exit 0 = all pass)
