judge.py — unified entrypoint: route a proof bundle to the right judge by its task.

The harness now has TWO judges, and this is the single door in front of both:

  * bench/quantum-judge/judge_verify.py — quantum-circuit correctness (state_prep,
    vqe, populations, architecture, classify).
  * bench/kernel-judge/judge_kernel.py  — the TPU Oracle-Diff Gate: kernel
    correctness on real silicon (kernel-correctness-oracle, roofline-attest).

Both judges share one contract — a SELF-CONTAINED, OFFLINE, numpy-only, exit-code
verdict where the judge recomputes the claim and REJECTs a forgery — and the SAME
exit codes (0 ok · 2 schema · 3 structure · 4 reproducibility · 5 performance ·
6 anti-overfit). This router reads the bundle's `task`, dispatches to the matching
judge, and returns that judge's exit code unchanged. The verdict is the exit code,
not any claim in the bundle.

Usage:
  python3 judge.py <bundle.json> [--json]     # any task type, routed automatically
